Hi
* greeting

< Aloha Human!
* welcome

How do you work?
* request_for_help

< I know a fair amount about books and what they are about. You can tell me the name of a book (ideally including the author's name), and I'll tell you about some books that might
be good followups. Or you can ask what's popular right now. Say "start over" to start over. Say "gift" if you're looking for a gift for someone.

< For example you can say "I loved Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins", or "What's popular right now?" (and that's all the help I have right now). If you want to do this the old-fashioned
way, you can try our website: https://www.thehawaiiproject.com/best-gift-books
